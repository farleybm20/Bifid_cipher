Using this cipher is very simple!

Running the program will first ask you the mode you are using. You will answer either 'encrypt' or 'decrypt' depending on your needs.

If encrypting, you will enter three things.

1. The plaintet message that you want to encrypt
2. The key for the cipher. This should be a 25 character string consising only of alphabetical characters
3. The period for the cipher - this should be somewhere between 1 and 100. 5 would be a normal value.

If decrypting, it will also ask you for 3 things. The first parameter is just the encrypted message you want to decrypt and the other two are the same.
